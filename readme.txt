only 4 tiles
once I have the code for 1, all I have to do is multiple
	-need random order code (program to stop that # of moves, at each increment (1, 2, 3, etc.)
	-I know how to change the background with a counter now
	-I can make the graphics cool (portfolio appeal)

-1 master with 4 numbers, with each number assigned to a function. The master will be programed ++ with each click
-each turn will be stored in an array that wipes each time (could just create a new var with each ++ (var1++ leads to var2, etc.)
-each tile has an assigned #, and the array indexes is checked against each press, to return try or false (if true move to the next index, and if false alert(make alert box fancier graphically)


-list tech and list how i githubed it
